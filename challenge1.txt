List challenge problems completed as part of the lab 1 handin, as well
as the problem number.

challenge 1: 
We create a new header file named 'color.h' in directory 'inc'. We define some basic colors as below:

#define BLUE 1
#define GREEN 2
#define RED 4
#define BWHITE 15
#define WHITE 7
#define ORANGE 6
#define YELLOW 14
#define BLACK 0
#define GRAY 8


Also, we define a global variable named current_color which is the color using now.

We add "case 'C'" in the function 'vprintfmt' in the 'lib/printfmt.c' file to handle the color control.After a string terminates, we set the current color to default white.

In the function cga_putc in 'console.c', the argument 'c' is used to control the color. The 8th-11th bit represents Blue, Green, Red, Highlight respectively. Therefore after we got the number of current color, we need to shift left 8 bits.




how to test: Users can use "%C" formatter when using cprintf. We already add some test cases in 'monitor' function ,after make qemu, the test cases will come out.
Example:
	cprintf("%C%s\n", BLUE, "BLUE");
	cprintf("%C%s\n", GREEN, "GREEN");
	cprintf("%C%s\n", YELLOW, "YELLOW");
	cprintf("%C%s\n", RED, "RED");
	cprintf("%C%s\n", BWHITE, "BRIGHT WHITE");
