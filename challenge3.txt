List challenge problems completed as part of the lab 3 handin, as well

as the problem number.  If you worked any previous lab challenges and

submitted them with this lab, list them here, along with the lab number.

Challenge 1:
Instead of defining a lot of entries in trap.c, we define a function array entries in trapentry.S. Change the two macro TRAPHANDLER_NOEC and TRAPHANDLER to save a 64 bit function entry.  
Thus, in trap.c we can easily install all handler function by using a for loop.


Challenge 2:
1. 'si' command:
	What we did here is to set the Trap flag(bit 8) of Eflags. Set it to 1 to make it allow single instruction otherwise diable it. Also when FL_TF  is set to 1, there will be a T_DEBUG interrupts, which is caught by trap_dispatch.

	Example:
	  Run make qemu, JOS will run bearkpoint.c
	  Run si command and look at the rip register in the trapframe and make sure it is the same instruction order in breakpoint.asm

2. 'continue' command:
	Similar to above, just set Trap flag to 0 to disable single instruction.
